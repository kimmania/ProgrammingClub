# ProgrammingClub

Code written to solve challenges from "Programming Challenges" and other coding challenges done through a small group of developers.  These are my submissions.

Written using Visual Studio or LINQPad (a gem of a free tool , extensions end in .linq). Most are written using C#, but I have incorporated some F#.

For most of the group gatherings, we would shoot for two goals
* fastest execution time over the same data set
* most creative solution for solving the problem

I frequently invested the time to go for most creative, I enjoyed thinking outside the box.

This eventually turned into exercises just for myself.

1. PC 110101 The 3n + 1 Problem
2. PC 110102 Minesweeper
3. PC 110104 LCD Display

6. PC 110107 Check the Check
7. PC 110108 Australian Voting
8. PC 110202 Poker Hands
9. PC 110204 Crypt Kicker
10. PC 110205 Stack 'em Up
11. PC 110208 Yahtzee
12. Calcualte Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (similiar to the Erdos number PC 110206)
    * https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2013/11/22/degrees-kevin-bacon/
    * used the Kevin Bacon stuff as I could pull data to test against where as finding raw data for Erdos was problematic
13. PC 110301 WERTYU
14. PC 110302 Where's Waldorf
15. PC 110303 Common Permutation
16. PC 110304 Crypt Kicker II
