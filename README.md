# ProgrammingClub

Code written to solve challenges from "Programming Challenges" and other coding challenges done through a small group of developers.  These are my submissions.

Written using Visual Studio or LINQPad (a gem of a free tool , extensions end in .linq). Most are written using C#, but I have incorporated some F#.

For most of the group gatherings, we would shoot for two goals
* fastest execution time over the same data set
* most creative solution for solving the problem

I frequently invested the time to go for most creative, I enjoyed thinking outside the box.

This eventually turned into exercises just for myself.
