TEST FILES:

Code snippets do not show that all arithmetic results are reduced to modulo 1000.





testdata.txt
============

the test file mentioned in the Programming Challenge #5 specs document.

expected results:  16

roughly equivalent to:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
}


10-factorial.txt
================

calculates 1! through 10!, saving each result

expected results:  74

roughly equivalent to:

int[] results = new int[10];
int product = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	product *= (i + 1);
	results[i] = product;
}


nest loops.txt
==============

expected results:  259

roughly equivalent to:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
	{
	}
}




testdata_916.txt
================
expected results: 916

Randomly generated series of numbers that were tweaked to refrain from becoming an infinite loop.  Has 1000 instructions.



Triple nested loops.txt
=======================
expected results: 30,451,517

Brian created a series of loops that will tax the code.


Triple nested loops 10x20x25.txt
================================
expected results:  1,894,803,587

Brian created a series of loops that will tax the code even more than the above file.
