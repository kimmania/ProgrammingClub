1) LCD1
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	Uses File.OpenText as my reader of data
	Reads one line at a time
	Splits on ' ' before passing to method for processing
	Uses StringBuilder to build up each individual line before writing to disk.  Initialize the size of the StringBuilder to expected size of the output, initialize stringbuilder as class variables, clear before using
	Writes to disk as each line of text is completed

2) LCD2
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	File.ReadAllText to retrieve text from file
	Uses Regular Expression matches to pass into the method to process individual lines
	Has same processing of individual numbers as LCD1

5) LCD5
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	Uses File.OpenText as my reader of data
	Uses ReadLines and loops over the resulting array
	Splits on ' ' before passing to method for processing
	Uses StringBuilder to build up each individual line before writing to disk.  Initialize the size of the StringBuilder to expected size of the output
	Writes to disk as each line of text is completed

7) 	LCD3
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	Uses File.OpenText as my reader of data
	Uses ReadLines and loops over the resulting array
	Splits on ' ' before passing to method for processing
	Modified Processing to write to the output file instead of storing everything in objects for the individual lines

8) LCD6
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	Uses File.OpenText as my reader of data
	Uses ReadLines and loops over the resulting array
	Splits on ' ' before passing to method for processing
	Uses a class of text to print out instead of calculating the strings
	Uses StringBuilder to build up each individual line before writing to disk.  Initialize the size of the StringBuilder to expected size of the output, initialize stringbuilder as class variables, clear before using
	Writes to disk as each line of text is completed

Because LCD6 was faster than all of the others, I incorporated the changes from LCD6 into LCD1, 2, 3, 4.  The only didfference between LCD5 and LCD6 are restricted to the size class work.

9) LCD4
	Completely reworked the algorithm to generate the formatted output using string.formats in the processor

Repurposed the following because they were significantly slower than the original LCD1 and LCD2...
3) LCD3
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	Uses File.OpenText as my reader of data
	Reads one line at a time
	Splits on ' ' before passing to method for processing
	Writes all of the lines at once by combining the StringBuilder at the end

4) LCD4
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	File.ReadAllText to retrieve text from file
	Uses Regular Expression matches to pass into the method to process individual lines
	Has same processing of individual numbers as LCD3

6) LCD4
	Uses Stream Writer to write the data to disk
	File.ReadAllText to retrieve text from file
	Uses Regular Expression matches to pass into the method to process individual lines
	Modified Processing to write to the output file instead of storing everything in objects for the individual lines
