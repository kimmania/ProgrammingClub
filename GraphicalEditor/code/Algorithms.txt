WIP

Need to create a faster way to cast the strings to ints
	IntParseFast() is faster than Convert.ToInt32() over a million attempts -- ~8 milliseconds
	Found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/638496/what-is-fastest-int-convert-toint32x-or-int32-parsex
		added 
		public static int IntParseFast(string value)
		{
			int result = 0;
			for (int i = 0; i < value.Length; i++)
			{
				result = 10 * result + (value[i] - 48);
			}
			return result;
		}
		which performed extrodinarily faster than the parse over a million conversions, this method took 3 milliseconds compared to 121 for IntParseFast

	would a dictionary look up be faster than converting? based on above, will look at this compairison sometime in the future.

Pass parameters by reference --- this would require me to declare a whole boat load of variables, not sure I want to do this
	-- attempted this, the assignment slowed down the algorithm ever so slightly, so going with the first approach

Store as class variables instead of passing into method (if makes sense)


Don't forget about order of points

Would it be faster to use a one dimensional array for the entire image (flatten)?  Can I use nifty tricks with this approach?  Like parallel processing and linq
